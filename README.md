# TofuPass

A privacy-focused, client-side password generator. Everything runs in your browser — no server ever sees what you generate.

**Live site:** [tofupass.com](https://tofupass.com)
**API backend:** [tofupass-api](https://github.com/Tofu-Water-Drinker/tofupass-api) (separate repo)

## What it does

- Generates memorable passwords using curated word lists + `crypto.getRandomValues()` (the Web Crypto CSPRNG)
- Three strength tiers: Soft (word+word+number), Firm (symbol+Word+Word+number), Extra Firm (four-word passphrase)
- Includes a **Stress Tester** that checks passwords against Have I Been Pwned using k-Anonymity (only a 5-char hash prefix leaves your device)
- Offers a free **[API](https://github.com/Tofu-Water-Drinker/tofupass-api)** for programmatic generation — no auth, no rate-limit drama

No accounts. No analytics. No cookies. No tracking pixels. Works offline once loaded.

## Tech stack

## A note on the word lists

The curated word lists used on the production site are **intentionally kept private** to keep password outputs less predictable. They are not distributed with this repo. A minimal stub lives at `assets/js/wordlists.sample.js` that clones use automatically — the generator will work out of the box, it'll just draw from a smaller pool.

If you want bigger lists, drop in your own `assets/js/wordlists.js` (same shape as the sample: `adjectives`, `nouns`, `specials` arrays on `window`). The real file is gitignored so your local copy won't leak into commits.
